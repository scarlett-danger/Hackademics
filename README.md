Lesson plan and learning materials for practical hacking

## Lesson 1 - Operational Security & Risk Assessment 
Before you even begin to think about doing any type of hack you should assess risk and ensure that your Operational Security (OpSec) is solid. Risk is definded by the threat, which is the potential for something bad to happen, times the opporutnity for something bad to happen. Operational security are the steps taken to protect yourself from being identified or attacked. This can include using a VPN and setting up sockpuppet accounts to following behaviors where you will not talk about your personal life to reveal your real identity. 

You should think of the following questions to youself as you start to consider a hack: 
1. Am I jepordizing my safety and wellbeing by attacking this target?
   - Consider the potential consequences of your actions, both legal and personal. 
2. Is the reward worth the risk?
   - Are you going to risk your job, reputaiton, and freedom for money, ego, or political activism? 
3. What are the penalites for getting caught?
   - Understand the local and federal laws. Know your rights and possibly have an attorney in your rolodex that you can contact if you happen to get in a tough spot (accidents happen).
